## About
This is a simple shell completely written in Python that bridges the gap between new and frequent users of **Linux** 🐧 commands. Two major features enable natural language to activate valid Linux commands. First, an emoji translator links a set of icons semantically close in meaning to eahc registered command. Second, an NLP interpretor ranks the set of registered commands based on document similarity scores between user input and training sentences, of courses choosing the command with the highest score. The natural language interpretation was mostly accomplished thanks to the *Spacy* libary in Python, although *Jina AI* API reached lesser progress earlier when running the shell in a `jinaai/jina` Docker container. Although this was tested in **Docker** 🐋 and **Linode** 🟩 in the terminal, it is guaranteed to work all the time only in **Repl.it** 🍥 shell environment.

## How to Use
